Some shell scripts I made and came to use over and over

If you find any of those useful as well feel free to use, point other people to here or whatever you see fit.
Some might contain code i took over from others buit forgot of whome or when. If you think this applies to you drop me a message.

The license is MIT since i couldn't find the ICS license in the list.
If there is a GPL on any file and You would like to use a more liberal license contact me so we figure something out.
